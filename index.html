      <h3 style="padding-top:-5px;">Introduction</h3><p> <i>My Parents </i><br/> In 1987, my father came to the United States from Bangladesh on a student visa. He began working at a local pharmacy in Astoria. Pull factors for my father to come to America were the hopes of a better future and economic stability. <br/><br/> In 1996, my mother and father got married. In December of 1996, my mother immigrated to the US. My mothers pull factors were my father via arranged marriage. </p>

      <p> <br/><i>My Family </i><br/> My parents are both Muslim, and I have subsequently grown up in Islam. I live with my mother, my father, and my brother, who is four years older than me (currently at St.Johns). Im fortunately quite close to all of my family members!</p>

      <h3 style="padding-top:0px;">Culture in My Family</h3> <p> <i>Mishti </i><br/> Sweets, or mishti, are a big part of Bengali culture. Many sweets in Bangladesh are district-based, such as bbibbikanna pita which is a sweet specific to my mother’s part of Bangladesh, or gulab jamun, pictured on the right (made by my mom!). The sweets my family makes, for example, would differ from the sweets that families from other parts of Bangladesh make. Mishti recipes are usually passed down from generation to generation; they are not readily available on the Internet (Md Al Momen). In my culture, it is tradition to feed other people mishti to celebrate new beginnings, such as a marriage or a new job. </p>

      <h3 style="padding-top:0px;">Popular Culture</h3> <p style="padding-right:50px;"> <i>Clothing </i><br/> A popular cultural trait that my family follows is the clothing we wear. Salwar kameez, lehengas, and saris are all women’s attire that my mother and I adorn. Of the three, my favorite is the lehenga, a two-piece with a cropped blouse and a long skirt. This outfit originated in 10th century India when Mughals took control of the region (Vaishnavi Nagwekar). It persisted as a part of Bangladeshi culture when Bangladesh gained independence in 1971. The lehenga is typically worn during weddings and is worn by Muslim brides during wedding receptions. Men in Bengali culture also have cultural clothing- kurtas. We wear these clothes on a multitude of occasions, such as on Eid, during weddings, or at regular household gatherings. <i>(top left: baby me; bottom left: my cousins and I; top right: my cousin and her husband getting married, along with her bridesmaids; bottom right: my father and I during Bengali New Year)</i></p>

      <h3>My Family & Culture</h3> <p> <i>Would I continue these cultural traits?</i><br/>My family is very in touch with Bengali culture. My mother and father grew up following these cultural traditions and, by default, passed them down to my brother and I. These traits may have persisted in my family because they allow us to identify with our ethnic backgrounds regardless of us living in the United States. These cultural traits are important because they are meaningful to both past and present generations of Bengalis. I will definitely continue these traditions, as they are a big part of my Bengali-American identity and how I have been raised. I feel that it is important for future generations in my family to learn the language and celebrate the culture that we most relate to. <i>(from left to right): my brother, my father, me, and my mother)</i> </p>

      <h3 style="padding-top:0px;">My Family's Movement</h3> <p><br/>My father came to the United States in the 1980s. He married my mother in 1996. Soon thereafter, my mother came to the United States. My parents were both voluntary migrants since they both came here in hopes of better socioeconomic conditions (“Migrations May Be Forced or Voluntary - Causes and Impacts Relating to Forced and Voluntary Migration - Higher Geography Revision - BBC Bitesize”). Both lived in Astoria at the time, the place where my brother and I were both born and raised. In 2015, our family moved to Queens Village and purchased our first (and only) home. <i>(1st image: my mom outside our home!, 2nd image: my freinds and I!)</i> </p>

      <h3 style="padding-top:0px;">Conclusion</h3> <p style="padding-right:50px;"> <i>My Story </i><br/> Growing up in New York City has allowed me to simultaneously be influenced by both my family’s culture and the plethora of cultures surrounding me. I have had the opportunity to grow up in a very diverse community which allowed me to learn a lot about people from all parts of the globe. My parents raised me close to Bengali culture, which is further influenced by me growing up in the United States. While some may assume that this causes me to feel torn between cultures, I, in turn, feel that this has enabled me to better understand and appreciate all cultures.<i>(top left: my childhood best friend and I; bottom left: my brother and I; right: my cousins and I last week!)</i></p>
